                 &nbsp; 

                <p><strong>Risk:</strong>  Medium. Even if they mean well, hacking without permission is still illegal in many places.</p>

                <p>They break the rules, hack without permission, and often do it to steal, destroy, or cause harm.</p>
                &nbsp;

                <p>They might target websites, banks, companies—or even regular people—to take money, data, or control.</p>

                <p>“How can I break into this system and take something valuable—without getting caught?”</p>
                &nbsp;

                
                <p>They’re like cyber thieves, hiding in the shadows, always looking for a weak spot to exploit.</p>
                &nbsp;

                <p><strong>Where They Operate:</strong>Secret underground forums, dark web, illegal cybercrime groups</p>
                &nbsp;

                <p><strong>How much they earn:</strong>It varies—some make nothing, others steal millions</p>
                &nbsp;
                
                <p><strong>Risk:</strong>Very high. If caught, they can face heavy fines or years in prison.</p>
